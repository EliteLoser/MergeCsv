# MergeCsv

Merge-Csv is a function in the MergeCsv module for PowerShell which is now also here on GitHub.

It works well with PowerShell version 3 and up - and might sort of work with PowerShell version 2.
PowerShell version 3 or higher is recommended.

Online blog documentation: http://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/Merge_CSV_files_or_PSObjects_in_PowerShell

I will add more information here later, but for now check out the online docs which are quite comprehensive.
